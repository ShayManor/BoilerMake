# BoilerMake

1 function of the website will have a repository using mongodb that holds all the different AI agents.

Each AI agent will have a name, description, and flag for which AI agent.
Users will prompt the AI and the AI will build the agent and it can be downloaded as an executable that is simple to use.
You tell the AI what you need, it asks you follow up questions, and you will answer then it will make the agent.
If the AI agent already exists, it will be on the repository and they will respond.
